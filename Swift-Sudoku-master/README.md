### Abstract
[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) is a logic-based 9x9 grid based number-placement puzzle so that each region contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.  The app will start up in a view allowing the user to select whether they wish to start an easy or hard puzzle. If the user had a game in progress, they should also have the option to continue their existing game. Once a selection has been made, youâ€™ll switch to a different view controller presenting the puzzle interface.
